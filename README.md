1.) Inputs for probe simulations are found in SingleProbeVariables.mat. Inputs for probe simulations for only one- and two-way probes are found in SingleProbeVariables_short.mat.

2.) These inputs can be loaded into the scripts GenerateProbeData_3l_HN.m, GenerateProbeData_3l_LN.m, GenerateProbeData_5l_HN.m, and GenerateProbeData_5l_LN.m 

3.) The outputs for these scripts contain the lists of good probes for single probes, barcodes, and two barcodes along with the lists of probes removed in each round.
